* customer entering the store
* customer movement 
* customer exiting the store

# Development

## Dependencies

Dependencies of the project are contained in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. All the packages are publicly
available.

All the packages can be installed with:
`pip install -f requirements.txt`

## Service configuration

The service reads the following **environment variables**:

| Variable                   | Description   |        Default |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------------:|
| STORE_HEIGHT               |               |             10 |
| STORE_WIDTH                |               |              6 |
| CUSTOMERS_AVERAGE_IN_STORE | 	          |              6 |
| CUSTOMERS_LIST_FILE        |               |  customers.csv |
| MQTT_HOST                  |               |              - |
| MQTT_PORT                  |               |           1883 |
| MQTT_NAME                  |               |     demoClient |
| ENTER_TOPIC                |               | customer/enter |
| MOVE_TOPIC                 |               |  customer/move |
| EXIT_TOPIC                 |               |  customer/exit |
| LOG_LEVEL                  | logging level |           INFO |
| LOG_FILENAME               | log file name |             '' |

(Parameters with `-` in the "Default" column are required.)

Use env variables [log_config.py](./app/log_config.py) to **configure logging behaviour**.
By default, console is used for logging. File handler is added if `LOG_FILENAME` is provided.

## Running the service

For development, I created a project with a dedicated virtual environment (Python 3.8, all the dependencies installed
there).

The code reads sensitive information (tokens, secrets) from environment variables. They need to be set accordingly in
advance.
`environment.variables.sh` can be used for that purpose. Then, in order to run the service the following commands can be
used:

```shell
$ . .environment.variables.sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload --reload-dir app
```

> Please, note `reload-dir` switch. Without it the reloader goes into an infinite loop because it detects log file changes (messages.log).

## Testing with MQTT broker in docker

[Check DEPLOYMENT tips](../DEPLOYMENT.md) to find out how to deploy and use the MQTT service for development purposes.

### Testing without MQTT
There is an environment variable, `TESTING_MOCK_MQTT`, that will create an MQTT client mock instead of trying to connect
to a real MQTT broker. Instead of publishing the messages, they will be simply logged/printed out.

This may be helpful for local development or testing.

### Producing test messages

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/produce_entry -d '{"id": "997", "ts": 192326400}'
```

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/produce_exit -d '{"id": "997", "ts": 192326400}'
```

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/produce_move -d '{"id": "997", "ts": 192326400, "x": 2, "y": 3}'
```

# Deployment

## Docker image
The docker image for the service is [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
It is based on FastAPI "official" image.
See https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker
for the details on configuring the container (http port, log level, etc.)

In order to build the image use:

```shell
docker build -t customersim-service:0.0.1 .
```

> Set image name (`customersim-service`) and tag (`0.0.1`) according to
> your needs.

To run the service as a Docker container run:

```shell
docker run -d -e LOG_LEVEL="warning"  --name customersim-service customersim-service:0.0.1
```

## Connecting to a secured broker
**TODO** Add info about setting user/password
**TODO** Add info about using client certificates (TLS)
